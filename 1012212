Okay, here's a detailed breakdown of how to implement this AI-powered audit report analysis system in Google Colab, along with code examples:

1. Setting Up the Environment:

Create a New Colab Notebook: Open a new Google Colab notebook by navigating to https://colab.research.google.com/.

Install Libraries:

!pip install transformers
!pip install rouge_score
!pip install datasets
!pip install sentencepiece
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

transformers: Provides the necessary libraries for using pre-trained models (T5, BART, BERT, RoBERTa).

rouge_score: Used for calculating the ROUGE metric to evaluate summaries.

datasets: Facilitates loading and preprocessing data.

sentencepiece: Used for tokenization in some models.

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Gather Audit Reports:

Real-world Data: If you have access to real audit reports, collect a representative dataset.

Open-Source Datasets: Explore Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other sources for publicly available audit-related datasets.

Mock Data: Create a synthetic dataset with sample audit reports.

Preprocessing:

import pandas as pd

def preprocess_text(text):
   text = text.lower()  # Lowercase
   text = text.replace('\n', ' ')  # Remove newlines
   # ... Add any other preprocessing steps you deem necessary
   return text

# Example: Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv('audit_reports.csv')  # Replace with your data file
df['report_text'] = df['report_text'].apply(preprocess_text)
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

3. Summarization (T5/BART):

Choose a Model:

T5: https://huggingface.co/google/t5-base

BART: https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-base

Load and Fine-tune:

from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
from transformers import BartTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration

# Example with T5 (replace with BART if preferred)
model_name = "google/t5-base"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Fine-tune on audit report data (need to prepare your data)
from datasets import load_from_disk, DatasetDict
dataset = load_from_disk('your_audit_report_dataset')
# Define training arguments and start fine-tuning
# ... (Code for fine-tuning is more complex, refer to Hugging Face Transformers docs)
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

Generate Summaries:

def generate_summary(report_text):
   inputs = tokenizer(report_text, max_length=512, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
   summary_ids = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=128, num_beams=4)
   summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
   return summary

# Example usage:
report_text = df['report_text'].iloc[0]  # Get a report from your data
summary = generate_summary(report_text)
print(f"Original Report:\n{report_text}\n\nSummary:\n{summary}")
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

4. Question Answering (BERT/RoBERTa):

Choose a Model:

BERT: https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased

RoBERTa: https://huggingface.co/roberta-base

Load and Fine-tune:

from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForQuestionAnswering
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaForQuestionAnswering

# Example with BERT (replace with RoBERTa if preferred)
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Fine-tune on audit report data (prepare your data with questions and answers)
from datasets import load_from_disk, DatasetDict
dataset = load_from_disk('your_audit_question_answer_dataset')
# ... (Code for fine-tuning, refer to Hugging Face Transformers docs)
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

Answer Questions:

def answer_question(report_text, question):
   inputs = tokenizer(question, report_text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
   output = model(**inputs)
   start_logits = output.start_logits
   end_logits = output.end_logits
   answer_start = torch.argmax(start_logits)
   answer_end = torch.argmax(end_logits) + 1 
   answer = tokenizer.decode(inputs['input_ids'][0][answer_start:answer_end])
   return answer

# Example usage:
report_text = df['report_text'].iloc[0]
question = "What were the key findings of the audit?"
answer = answer_question(report_text, question)
print(f"Question: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}")
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

5. Evaluation:

Summarization Evaluation (ROUGE):

from rouge_score import rouge_scorer

def evaluate_summary(generated_summary, reference_summary):
    scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)
    scores = scorer.score(generated_summary, reference_summary)
    return scores

# Example usage:
generated_summary =  generate_summary(report_text)  # Get summary from previous step
reference_summary = "This is a sample reference summary for evaluation." 
scores = evaluate_summary(generated_summary, reference_summary)
print(scores)
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

Question Answering Evaluation (BLEU and EM):

from datasets import load_metric

def evaluate_qa(generated_answer, reference_answer):
    metric = load_metric("bleu")
    metric.add_batch(predictions=[generated_answer], references=[[reference_answer]])
    bleu_score = metric.compute()
    em_score = 1 if generated_answer.strip() == reference_answer.strip() else 0
    return bleu_score, em_score

# Example usage:
generated_answer = answer_question(report_text, question)
reference_answer = "The audit found that the company's internal controls were lacking."
bleu_score, em_score = evaluate_qa(generated_answer, reference_answer)
print(f"BLEU Score: {bleu_score}")
print(f"Exact Match: {em_score}")
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

6. Deployment (Flask/FastAPI):

Create a Web Application:

Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/

FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

Colab Integration:

Use a library like gradio or streamlit to build a simple user interface within Colab for prototyping.

Create a requirements.txt file with all the necessary libraries, which you can then use to deploy to a cloud platform.

API Endpoints:

Define API endpoints using Flask/FastAPI to expose your summarization and question-answering functionalities.

Gemini API Integration:

This will require obtaining access to the Gemini API and using its provided documentation to integrate conversational interaction with your web application.

Example Flask Code (Simplified):

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# ... (Load and fine-tune your models as shown in previous steps)

@app.route('/summarize', methods=['POST'])
def summarize():
    report_text = request.json['report_text']
    summary = generate_summary(report_text)  # Use your summarization function
    return jsonify({'summary': summary})

@app.route('/answer', methods=['POST'])
def answer():
    report_text = request.json['report_text']
    question = request.json['question']
    answer = answer_question(report_text, question) # Use your QA function
    return jsonify({'answer': answer})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Python

Key Points:

Fine-tuning is Crucial: Fine-tuning the models on audit-specific data is critical to achieve good performance on this task.

Data Quality: The quality and size of your training data will significantly impact the accuracy of your models.

Model Selection: Experiment with different models (T5, BART, BERT, RoBERTa) to find the best combination for your specific use case.

Gemini API: Refer to the Gemini API documentation for information on how to integrate it into your Flask/FastAPI application.

Remember: This is a starting point. You'll likely need to adapt and expand the code based on your specific dataset and application requirements. Good luck!
